# -HEART-STROKE-PREDICTION
Heart strokes have rapidly raised globally not only in older ages but also in juvenile ages. Stroke prediction is found to be a compound task that requires an enormous amount of data pre-processing. Also, there is a need to automatize the prophecy process for the early exposure of symptoms related to stroke so that it can be averted at an early stage. In this project, stroke prediction is observed on a data set collected from Kaggle. Different models anticipate the chances that a person will have a stroke based on symptoms like age, gender, average glucose level, hyper-tension, smoking status, body mass index, work type, and residence type. We aim to analyze the person's risk level by performing various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest. Hence, a provisional study is shown between the different algorithms and the most competent one is obtained.
